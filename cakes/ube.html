            Welcome to my page on my Ube Cake. This cake was my first cake I made to order. I love experimenting and seeing how difficult I can make something become! This particular cake is a homemade Ube cake, creamy custard filling, and italian meringue buttercream. Everything in this was homemade! I even opted to make my own Ube Jam, which is also called Ube Halaya, the jam itself is already a desert you can have on the side, or spoon it straight!

            My first cake product I sold to a friend. This ube cake is one of my favorite cakes. From the design, to the flavors, and all of the abone!

            <h2>The Cake</h2>
            In this ube Cake, there is a very specific process to make this. In this process we have to prep a few things first. There are a few steps that corporate together to make this lovely cake. 
            </br></br>     
            We put together our drys all in one bowl, then our liquids all in one bowl, then we have our ube jam with the egg yokes. We start with adding our flour mixture into our ube in thirds, then adding milk when it becomes thick, continue until everything is incorporated. 
            </br></br>
            Once we have this, we make our merginue, yes! There is merginue in the cake too! Insane right! We add merginue because our cake is a little too thick without it, we need a way to add air so the cake does not come out extremely dense and, we do not want that. Afte adding a little into the merginue, we then add the merginue into the ube batter, and slowly keep adding all the merginue, being careful to not destroy all the air bubbles in our cake. Once we are finished, next comes the easy step! Pour your batter into your cake pans, I like to use 9 inch pans, then pop them into the oven until ready! 
            </br></br>
            To finsih it off, when we take it out of the oven, we actually flip the cake over while its in the cake pan, this makes it so it doesnt fall in on itself, and stretches out those air bubbles!  

            <h2>The Custard</h2>
            The custard is pretty simple, with a slight simmer, using a base of eggs, milk, cream. We temper the eggs carefully so the eggs do not overcook.

            <h2>The Frosting</h2>
            I have a page dedicated to Swiss Merginue Buttercream which you can visit. Here is my <a class="nav" href="/frosting/swiss-merginue.html">Swiss Merginue Buttercream</a> page to learn more about it!
