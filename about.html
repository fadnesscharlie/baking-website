        I started off baking around high school, mostly was brownies, and no, there was no "special" ingredient in my brownies. Just chocolate, more chocolate, probably to much chocolate, and some walnuts. <br><br>
        I did not get into a lot of baking until much later, mainly the reason was I was the main person eating all of my baked goods, which is not bad. But I also did not want to go overboard as I wouldn't stop eating!<br><br>
        My baking addition really caught attention around 2018, I crafted a Cat Themed cat, you can see all of its glory below. After having a little taste of what I could do, I wanted to see how far I could take it. I began to do much more research, experiments, and trying to push myself to see what I could do. <br><br>
        Later towards 2019, my skills started to pick up, learning the small tips and tricks, <b>LOTS</b> of trail and error later. I sold my first cake! My <a class="nav" href="cakes/ube.html">Ube Cake</a>was my first cake, and by is my favorite cake that I have made! <br><br>
        After selling a few more, and many birthdays later, Covid hit, which had to halt many more creations. Covil will not last forever, and my adventure to make many more cakes and delicious foods will continue soon! As my sweet tooth will never leave my side, and I don't mind that at all. <br>

            <h2>My first cake</h2>The goal was very simple. A cat themed cake, simple right? Although, I was trying to make fur, and with frosting, lets just say I was a few years too early for this. I was even genius enough to stick toothpicks through each of the ears to make them stick. They did, for about an hour, then they deicded to up and slide off. <br><br>
            Till this day, I still want to complete a Cat Themed Cake. Once day I will, and i will probably try to look into marzipan as well. (I don't like fondont) Being able to get the textures a little more accurate will make all the better, and the quality will be much better! Now I'm getting excited just thinking about this... Lemme go to the kitchen real quick...

            <h2>Future in Baking</h2>
                The vast future. The sea of sugar, flour, eggs, milk, and oh so much more. There are so many more things I will be attempting for the furture. I personally wont be making this my career choice, but as a hobby on the side, oh you bet! So stay tuned for more cakes, cookies, everything baked, and more! There is just so many different things to try, taste, and create! And I can't wait!
